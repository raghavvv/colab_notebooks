        "1. AssemblyAI is designed to handle large volumes of transcription requests, making it suitable for applications that require high throughput.\n",

        "4. Librosa may be a good choice for feature manipulation and extraction in audio, but AssemblyAI does provide a more reliable system when it comes to transcription."
